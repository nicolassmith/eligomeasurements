This was an attempt to measure how much the OMC back-scatters into the
interferometer mode.  It was done by wiggling the OMC-SUS and
observing the scattering shelf in the PD spectrum.

Files:

OMCscatter2.xml	-> OMCscatter2.txt
  - .txt contains spectra of DARM background and two scattering trials
OMCscatter.xml
  - don't remember
OMCtimeseries.txt
  - plain OMC timeseries

Note: the original analysis (in the elog entry, appended below) is
wrong by a factor of a few, since it does not account for suppression
by the DARM loop.  Valera's entry in the elog is also missing a factor
of the optical gain (which is big).

Sorry the .m files are a big disorganized.

TEXT OF ELOG ENTRY 
===============================================================================

A moving object that scatters light back at the interferometer creates
a very characteristic "scattering shelf" signature in the spectrum
seen by a PD.  As the scattering source moves, it phase modulates the
light it reflects.  This phase modulation beats against the carrier
and and audio frequency amplitude noise to make the shelf. 

How this works is already well-known, but I decided to write it down
for myself:

The scattered beam has an electric field amplitude of

E_s = a E_0 exp{ i (2 A / lambda) (2 pi) sin Omega t }

where A is the amplitude of motion of the scatterer, Omega is the
frequency of motion, and a is the amplitude reflectivity of the
scattering source (the scattering coefficient).  This is phase
modulation with a modulation depth of

Gamma = 4 pi (A/lambda)

(for normal incidence on the scatterer)

The photodiode sees

P = |E_t + E_s|^2 

P = |E_t|^2 + |E_s|^2 + 2 Re E_t E_s

P = |E_0|^2 + 2 Re E_t E_s

where E_t = (1 - a) E_0 is the field that's transmitted rather than scattered.

Using the Jacobi-Anger identity, E_s can be expanded in terms of
sinusoids to find the power spectrum of the photodiode signal:

P = |E_0|^2 + 2 Re (E_s) (E_t)* Sum[ i^n J_n(Gamma) exp{i n Omega t} ]
 
P = |E_0|^2 + 2 |E_0|^2 a (1 - a) Re Sum[ i^n J_n(Gamma) exp{i n Omega t} ]

There are terms (sidebands) at all multiples of the phase modulation
frequency Omega.  Spectrally, this looks like a comb of delta
functions at integer multiples of Omega, whose amplitudes are given by
bessel functions J_N(Gamma), where N=f/Omega.  (Any AM noise on the
carrier will get superimposed on each of these spikes, smoothing out
the spectrum.)

It turns out that the amplitude of Bessel functions J_N(Gamma) dies
off very steeply with N after N>Gamma, which is what creates the sharp
cutoff of the "scattering shelf".  Using N_knee = Gamma gives:

f_knee = Omega * N_knee = Omega Gamma = 4 pi Omega (A / lambda)

Another way of seeing this is to consider the phase induced by the scattering source:

phi = Gamma sin Omega t
f_instantaneous = d phi/dt = Omega Gamma sin Omega t
f_instantaneous_max = Omega Gamma

which gets the same result.  Furthermore, an excitation of amplitude A
and frequency Omega has maximum velocity v = A Omega.  This can be
used to eliminate both A and Omega from the knee frequency:

f_knee = 4 pi (v / lambda)

(At this point, Mike Z admonishes, "Speed kills!")

Because Sum[ J_N(Gamma)^2 ] over all N equals 1, we can integrate the
power spectrum of the photodiode signal to directly measure 
2 |E_0|^2 a (1 - a).  We can then divide by the DC term to get the
scattering coefficient.



On Friday evening Valera and I wiggled the HAM6 ISI table to measure
scattering of light from HAM6 back into the interferometer (which in
turn reflects off the interferometer and comes back at the DC readout
photodiode).  Using the ISI for this is especially convenient because
our seismic friends have conscientiously calibrated their position
sensors in real units.
               
-Excitations-

We performed three excitations into L1:ISI-OMC_CONT_Y_EXC.  With the
isolation filter banks turned off at their inputs and all of the
filter modules turned off this excitation channel allows us to
directly excite the (uncontrolled) ISI table in the Y direction.  The
Y direction in ISI land cleverly corresponds to the axis of the Y arm,
i.e. we excited along the axis between HAM6 and the IFO beamsplitter.

GPS time    Duration     Amplitude
916817615   180 seconds  excitation = 16.5 microns amplitude at 0.3 Hz
916817805   430 seconds  excitation = 33.0 microns amplitude at 0.3 Hz
916818335                excitation = none

The excitation amplitudes were 1000 and 2000 counts, which we observed
to correspond to 16.5 and 33.0 microns via the ISI sensor channel
L1:ISI-OMC_CONT_Y_IN1.

-Resulting spectral shelves-

With these excitation amplitudes we saw a clear scattering shelf in the
DARM spectrum.   Looking at the shelf, the knee frequencies of the shelf
in the two exictations are at about 57 Hz and 108 Hz.

Using the expression 

<b>f_knee = 4 pi Omega (A / lambda)</b>

with

A      = 15.6 and 33.0 microns (excitation amplitude)
Omega  = 0.3 Hz                (excitation frequency)
lambda = 1064 nanometers       (laser wavelength)

gives predicted knee frequencies of 58.5 Hz and 117 Hz.  Remarkably
good agreement, I'd say!
 
-Estimating the scattering coefficient-

Integrating the area between the scattering shelf and the baseline
spectrum (of OMC-READOUT_OUT) gives the following values for the two
excitations:

a_rms = 0.067965   counts RMS for the 16 micron excitation
b_rms = 0.10882    counts RMS for the 33 micron excitation

(I think these quantities are supposed to be equal.  They were computed
as Sqrt[0.25 Hz * Sum[Y^2 - X^2]] where Y is the elevated spectrum ASD,
X is the baseline one, and 0.25 Hz was the binwidth.)

We have to undo the effect of the OMC_READOUT filter bank, which just
adds an offset and a gain:

OMC_READOUT_GAIN   was -73.245 
OMC_READOUT_OFFSET was -71.276

So the DC power on the OMC was -OMC_READOUT_OFFSET = 71.276 mA, and
the RMS scattered light was

a_rms / OMC_READOUT_GAIN = 1.0e-3 mA RMS scattering
b_rms / OMC_READOUT_GAIN = 1.5e-3 mA RMS scattering

Dividing by the DC value gives

alpha = 14e-6  (first excitation)
alpha = 21e-6  (second excitation)
