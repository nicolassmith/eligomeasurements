L1/H1 S6 shot noise estimates  -- elog: http://goo.gl/NFlVi
===============================================================================

These scripts try to dead-reckon the expected shot noise level using
measurements of the input power, recycling gain, and input and output
efficiencies.  The expected shot noise is compared to the actual
spectrum using h(t) data obtained using NDS2.  The NDS2 data is cached
in a file so that running the scripts multiple times on the same data
is fast.
