notes on measuring Contrast defect related stuff

first we go on bright michelson locked to OMC, then quickly shift to
dark michelson.

01 ---

try again, disable OMC alignment first

02 ---

now let the michelson free swing

03 --- shit disn't save

improve the alignment a little (it also isn't really swinging much)

04 ---

now we wanna look at 1 itm at a time

05 - ITMY

06 - ITMX

should be monitoring the input beam (how about more time too)

07 ITMX again

08 itmy again (forgot about more time)

now more time 

09 itmy

crap REFCAV and MC lost lock

10 itmy

increase itmx misalignment to be sure scattered light from itmx isn't affecting

11 itmy

now itmx

12 itmx

change itmy alignment to be sure scattered light not an issue

13 itmx

now measure dark levels

14 dark

try 1 arm mich for the halibut

15 bright 1armMich

16 dark 1 arm

17 DARM sweep

18 better alingment (no length integrator)

no deacon made things quieter

19 darm sweep cleaned up with all the goodness (alignment was good, but turned off, length integrator, koji fixed crackeling)

19 was NOT NICE stupid AS5 offset

20 is the shit (everything about 19 but after a lockloss (brought back to same QPD location (spob was still climbing)) and with no AS5 offset)
