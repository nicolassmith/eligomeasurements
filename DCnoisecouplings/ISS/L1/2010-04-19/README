From 4pm-9:30pm in astrowatch mode; from 9:30pm to midnight making
measurements of intensity noise transfer function to DARM, MICH, PRC,
REFL, etc.

The ISS to DARM transfer functions look quite different from when I
did similar measurements in January. If the dominant intensity noise
coupling is through the RF sidebands, perhaps this is not surprising.

From 11:30pm until 11:50pm we were locked on the other side of the
DARM fringe (x0=-15pm). I wanted to make the transfer function
measurements with various negative DARM offsets but didn't have time
to actually take any transfer functions here. I was tripped up by a
second place in the l1_rf2dc script that resets the DARM offset back
to the positive value, which of course was blowing the locks. I
commented this out since it is redundant.
