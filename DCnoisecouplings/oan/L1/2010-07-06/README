Oscillator Amplitude Noise test - elog: http://goo.gl/bpWfP

To check the calibration of the Marconi's AM drive, on 7/6 I locked the OMC to 
the 24 MHz RF sideband in a single bounce configuration and took a swept-sine 
from the Marconi excitation to OMC PD-SUM. The coupling level of sideband RIN 
per AM modulation depth agrees with expectation.
