CM000.78D  CM001.78S  SCRN0001.GIF -- Measurement of CM OLG during DC readout with 10 W input

-- Calibrating REFL_I --

Procedure:

1. Put an excitation on one of the ETMs.  In the absense of loops,
this produces equal DARM and CARM motion.

2. Measure the response in DARM_ERR and REFL_I.

3. Apply the DARM_ERR calibration.  This takes care of the suppression
of the DARM part of the motion.

4. Compensate for the CM suppression by multiplying by (1-G) where G
is the CM OLG at the probe frequency.

5. Equate the calibrated DARM and loop-corrected CARM.  This gives a
calibration for CARM in meters at the probe frequency.

6. Multiply by (d nu)/(d L) = -nu/L to convert from meters to Hz.

7. Assume a model for the CARM-->REFL_I transfer function to propagate
the calibration to other frequencies.  This transfer function is
simply the coupled-cavity pole (Rana's thesis, Eq. 3.5).

Results:

1. Used awggui to excite L1:SUS-ETMX_LSC_EXC at 7300 Hz

2. tdsdmd reported 3.8e-6 counts in DARM_ERR (coh 1.00 with 1500 avgs)
               and 5.0e-2 counts in REFL2_I  (coh 0.32 with 1500 avgs)
               and 43.3   counts L1:SUS-ETMX_LSC_EXC (coh 1.00)

3. DARM_ERR calibration at 7300 Hz is 1.276e-10 meters/count 

4. CM OLG at 7300 Hz is G_CM = 10.9 dB and -122.2 degrees, so the
   correction is (1 - G) = 12.3 dB and 45.9 degrees.

5.   (3.8e-6 counts) * (1.276e-10 meters/count) 
   = (5.0e-2 counts) * (12.3 dB) * REFL2I_calibration
   
  REFL2_I calibration = 3.8e-6 * 1.276e-10 / (5e-2 * undb(12.3)) 
  REFL2_I calibration = 2.35e-15 (residual meters)/count @ 7300 Hz

6. (d nu)/(d L) = - v / L = c / (L lambda) = 7e10 Hz/m
   with
     c = 3e8 meters/sec
     L = 4000 meters
     lambda = 1e-6 meters
 
  REFL2_I calibration = 1.66e-4 Hz/count @ 7300 Hz
  
7. Assume 1/f:

  REFL2_I calibration = 1.66e-4 Hz/count * [ f/(7300 Hz) ]

The frequency drive (LSC-MOD_3) was calibrated as following:

- Drove ETMX at 7100 Hz and measured DARM and REFL_I response. This gives the REFL_i calibration
3.35e-4 (DARM counts)*7.9e-11 (DARM m/c) /4.34e-2 (REFL_I counts)*3e14(Hz)/4e3(m)

- Drove MOD and measured REFL_I to get 4.77 (REFL_I counts)/1e-3 (MOD counts)

- Both measurements above were done with ifo locked on DC. It turns out we don't have very high 
CM loop gain at 7 kHz at the moment. The out of loop response REFL/MOD is about the same.

- Multiplied the MOD calibration by f/7100 to correct for the cavity pole (tx Rana for reminder).

The laser frequency noise coupling goes down with frequency as it should in DC readout but the
magnitude appears to be 10x larger than expected. Possible reasons for discrepancy 
with the modeled result are the DARM drive calibration at 7 kHz, the arm buildup imbalance, ...
